# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Twitter-Data-Using-NLP
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets to classify them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The project demonstrates key steps in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training and evaluation.
Key Components:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Loaded the dataset containing tweets along with their respective sentiment labels.
Explored the dataset to understand its structure and distribution of sentiment classes.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned the text data by removing special characters and irrelevant information.
Tokenized the text and removed stop words.
Applied stemming to reduce words to their root form.
Feature Extraction:

Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert the textual data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
Model Training:

Trained a logistic regression model to classify tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Technologies Used:

Python
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
nltk
scikit-learn

Conclusion:
This project effectively demonstrates how to apply NLP techniques and machine learning to perform sentiment analysis on social media data, providing insights into public opinion and sentiment.
